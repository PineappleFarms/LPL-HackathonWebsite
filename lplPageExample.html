					<h1><span style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Risks of Investing with LPL Investment Advisory Programs</b></span></h1>
<p>LPL Financial LLC (LPL) offers various types of advisory services and
 programs, including wrap fee programs, mutual fund asset allocation 
programs, an advisor-enhanced digital advice program, advisory programs 
offered by third-party investment advisor firms, financial planning 
services, and retirement plan consulting services. If you invest through
 LPL’s investment advisory programs, you may be exposed to many 
different types of securities, including stocks and bonds, registered 
investment companies like mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs),
 unregistered investment funds like hedge funds and private equity 
funds, alternative products, and other types of investments. Investing 
involves the risk of loss that investors should be prepared to bear.</p>
<p>The advisory service or program being offered to you may include 
exposure to the following assets and bear the following risks. You 
should discuss with your LPL financial professional the investments 
available in your program and the risks associated with those 
investments. You should also closely review the Form ADV Part 2A 
Brochure for the program or service being offered to you.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Alternative Strategy Mutual Funds and ETFs.</i> Certain mutual 
funds and/or ETFs invest primarily in alternative investments and/or 
strategies. Investing in alternative investments and/or strategies 
involves special risks, such as risks associated with commodities, real 
estate, leverage, selling securities short, the use of derivatives, 
potential adverse market forces, regulatory changes, and potential 
illiquidity. There are special risks associated with ETFs and mutual 
funds that invest principally in real estate securities, such as 
sensitivity to changes in real estate values and interest rates and 
price volatility because of the fund’s concentration in the real estate 
industry. These types of funds and ETFs tend to have higher expense 
ratios than more traditional mutual funds. They also tend to be newer 
and have less of a track record or performance history.</li>
<li><i>Business Development Companies (BDCs)</i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 115.0%;font-family: &quot;Avenir LT Std 55 Roman&quot; , sans-serif;">. </span>BDCs
 are types of closed-end investment companies that are available to 
investors in LPL advisory programs who meet certain qualification 
standards. Generally, BDCs invest primarily in the debt and equity of 
private and/or small U.S. companies, and may offer distribution rates 
generated through potentially significant credit and liquidity risk 
exposures amplified through leverage. As with other high-yield 
investments, such as floating-rate/leveraged loan funds, private real 
estate investment trusts (REITs), and limited partnerships, investors 
are exposed to significant market, credit, interest rate, and liquidity 
risks. In addition, BDCs run the risk of overleveraging their relatively
 illiquid portfolios. Some BDCs are not traded on national securities 
exchanges. Due to the illiquid nature of non-traded BDCs, investors’ 
exit opportunities may be limited to only periodic share repurchases by 
the BDC. A tender offer pursuant to a share redemption program may be 
oversubscribed so that the BDC accepts only a pro rata portion of the 
shares an investor tenders during a redemption program. In such cases, 
an investor may experience significant delays (including, potentially, 
indefinite delays) to exit from the investment. In addition, share 
redemption programs may be shut down at any time at the discretion of 
the issuer’s board. Also, BDCs may fund distributions from offering 
proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and 
reduce the amount of capital available to make investments. In some 
cases, there may be an additional cost to investors who redeem before 
holding the shares for a specified number of years.</li>
<li><i>Closed-End/Interval Funds</i>. Closed-end funds are investment 
companies that raise a fixed amount of capital through issuing a fixed 
number of shares. Registered closed-end funds may be traded on 
securities exchanges, but some closed-end funds may not give investors 
the right to redeem their shares, and a secondary market may not exist. 
Therefore, investors may be unable to liquidate all or a portion of 
their shares in these types of funds.&nbsp; While a closed-end fund may 
from time to time offer to repurchase shares, it is not obligated to do 
so (unless it has been structured as an "interval fund"). In the case of
 interval funds, the fund will provide limited liquidity to shareholders
 by offering to repurchase a limited amount of shares on a periodic 
basis, but there is no guarantee that investors will be able to sell all
 of the shares in any particular repurchase offer. The repurchase offer 
program may be suspended under certain circumstances.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Concentration Risk</i>. When an investment account concentrates 
its investments by investing a significant portion of its assets in the 
securities of a single issuer, industry, sector, country, or region, the
 overall adverse impact on the investor due to adverse developments in 
the business of the issuer, industry, sector, country or region could be
 considerably greater than if the investor did not concentrate its 
investments.</li>
<li><i>Credit Risk</i>. This is the risk that an investor could lose 
money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security is unable or
 unwilling to meet its financial obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).</i> ETFs are typically investment 
companies that are legally classified as open-end mutual funds or unit 
investment trusts (UITs). However, they differ from traditional mutual 
funds; in particular, ETF shares are listed on a securities exchange. 
Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of 
other publicly traded companies. ETF shares may trade at a discount or 
premium to their net asset value. This difference between the bid price 
and the ask price is often referred to as the “spread.” The spread 
varies over time based on the ETF’s trading volume and market liquidity,
 and is generally lower if the ETF has a lot of trading volume and 
market liquidity and higher if the ETF has little trading volume and 
market liquidity. Although many ETFs are registered as an investment 
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 like traditional mutual
 funds, some ETFs, in particular those that invest in commodities, are 
not registered as an investment company. ETFs may be closed and 
liquidated at the discretion of the sponsor.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs)</i>. An ETN is a senior unsecured 
debt obligation designed to track the total return of an underlying 
market index or other benchmark. ETNs may be linked to a variety of 
assets; for example, commodity futures, foreign currency, and equities. 
ETNs are similar to ETFs in that they are listed on an exchange and 
typically can be bought or sold throughout the trading day. However, an 
ETN is not a mutual fund and does not have a net asset value; the ETN 
trades at the prevailing market price. Some of the more common risks of 
an ETN are:<ul>
<li>The repayment of the principal and interest, if any, and the payment
 of any returns at maturity or upon redemption are dependent upon the 
ETN issuer’s ability to pay.</li>
<li>The trading price of the ETN in the secondary market may be 
adversely impacted if the issuer’s credit rating is downgraded.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The index or asset class for performance replication in an ETN may 
or may not be concentrated in a specific sector, asset class, or 
country, and may therefore carry specific risks.</li>
<li>ETNs may be closed and liquidated at the discretion of the issuing company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i style="">Hedge Funds and Managed Futures</i>. Hedge and managed 
futures funds may be purchased by investors meeting certain 
qualification standards in some LPL programs. Investing in these funds 
involves additional risks including, but not limited to, the risk of 
investment loss due to the use of leveraging and other speculative 
investment practices, the lack of liquidity, and performance volatility.
 In addition, these funds are not required to provide periodic pricing 
or valuation information to investors and may involve complex tax 
structures and delays in distributing important tax information. 
Investors should be aware that these funds are not liquid as there is no
 secondary trading market available. At the absolute discretion of the 
sponsor of the fund, there may be certain repurchase offers made from 
time to time. However, there is no guarantee that an investor will be 
able to redeem the fund during the repurchase offer. Issuers typically 
accept redemption requests only periodically (monthly or quarterly), and
 often have the discretion to suspend redemptions in times of market 
stress.&nbsp; Even after a redemption request is accepted, the 
redemption proceeds may not be available for a significant period of 
time following the effective date of the redemption. Also, a portion of 
the redemption proceeds may be withheld to account for potential future 
adjustments to the valuation of the security. Funds of hedge funds are 
pooled investments in several hedge funds. Expenses in funds of hedge 
funds are typically higher than mutual funds.&nbsp; Because they may 
invest in a number of private hedge funds, funds of funds also bear a 
part of the fees and expenses of those underlying hedge funds.</li>
<li><i>High-Yield Debt.</i> High-yield debt is issued by companies or 
municipalities that do not qualify for “investment grade” ratings by one
 or more rating agencies. The below-investment-grade designation is 
based on the rating agency’s opinion of an issuer that it has a greater 
risk to repay both principal and interest and a greater risk of default 
than those issuers rated investment grade. High yield debt carries 
greater risk than investment grade debt. There is the risk that the 
potential deterioration of an issuer’s financial health and subsequent 
downgrade in its rating will result in a decline in market value or 
default. Because of the potential inability of an issuer to make 
interest and principal payments, an investor may receive back less than 
originally invested. There is also the risk that the bond’s market value
 will decline as interest rates rise and that an investor will not be 
able to liquidate a bond before maturity.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Interest Rate Risk.</i> This is the risk that fixed income 
securities will decline in value because of a change in interest rates; a
 bond or a fixed income fund with a longer duration will be more 
sensitive to changes in interest rates than a bond or bond fund with a 
shorter duration.</li>
<li><i>Investment Company Risk. </i>When an investor invests in 
investment companies, such as ETFs, mutual funds, closed-end funds, 
UITs, and other types of investment companies, the investor’s account 
performance will be affected by the performance of those investment 
companies. Investments in investment companies are subject to the risks 
of the investment companies’ investments, as well as to the investment 
companies’ expenses. If an investor invests in investment companies, the
 investor’s account may receive distributions of taxable gains from 
portfolio transactions by that investment company and may recognize 
taxable gains from transactions in shares of that investment company, 
which would be taxable when distributed.</li>
<li><i>Issuer‐Specific Risk. </i>This is the risk that the value of an 
individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile 
than the market as a whole and can perform differently from the value of
 the market as a whole.</li>
<li><i>Leveraged and Inverse ETFs, ETNs and Mutual Funds.</i> Leveraged 
ETFs, ETNs, and mutual funds, sometimes labeled “ultra” or “2x,” for 
example, are designed to provide a multiple of the fund’s underlying 
index's return, typically on a daily basis. Inverse products are 
designed to provide the opposite of the return of the fund’s underlying 
index, typically on a daily basis. These products are different from and
 can be riskier than traditional ETFs, ETNs, and mutual funds. Although 
these products are designed to provide returns that generally correspond
 to the fund’s underlying index, they may not be able to exactly 
replicate the performance of the index because of fund expenses and 
other factors. This is referred to as tracking error. Continual 
resetting of returns within the product may add to the underlying costs 
and increase the tracking error. As a result, this may prevent these 
products from achieving their investment objective. In addition, 
compounding of the returns can produce a divergence from the fund’s 
underlying index over time, in particular for leveraged products. In 
highly volatile markets with large positive and negative swings, return 
distortions may be magnified over time. Some deviations from the stated 
objectives, to the positive or negative, are possible and may or may not
 correct themselves over time. To accomplish their objectives, these 
products use a range of strategies, including swaps, futures contracts, 
and other derivatives. These products may not be diversified and can be 
based on commodities or currencies. These products may have higher 
expense ratios and be less tax-efficient than more traditional ETFs, 
ETNs, and mutual funds.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Liquidity Risk. </i>This is the risk that an investor would not 
be able to sell or redeem an investment quickly, or would not be able to
 sell or redeem an investment quickly without significantly affecting 
the price. Liquidity risk is heightened when markets are distressed. 
Generally, alternative investments have higher liquidity risk than 
equities, fixed income securities, mutual funds, or ETFs.</li>
<li><i>Margin Accounts. </i>Some advisory programs at LPL allow an 
investor to borrow on margin. Investors should be aware that margin 
borrowing involves additional risks. Margin borrowing will result in 
increased gain if the value of the securities in the account goes up, 
but will result in increased losses if the value of the securities in 
the account goes down. LPL, acting as the investor’s creditor, will have
 the authority to liquidate all or part of the account to repay any 
portion of the margin loan, even if the timing would be disadvantageous 
to the investor. For performance illustration purposes, the margin 
interest charge will be treated as a withdrawal and will, therefore, not
 negatively impact performance reports.</li>
<li><i>Market Risk.</i> This is the risk that the value of securities 
owned by an investor may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or 
unpredictably, due to factors affecting securities markets generally or 
particular industries. Market disruptions can be caused by economic, 
financial, or political events and factors, including war or other armed
 conflicts, geopolitical developments (including trading and tariff 
arrangements, sanctions, and cybersecurity attacks), instability in 
developing regions, terrorism, natural disasters, economic recessions, 
and public health epidemics. The extent and duration of these events and
 resulting market disruptions cannot be predicted, but could be 
substantial. Global events can adversely affect both the U.S. and 
foreign financial markets and lead to increased volatility, reduced 
liquidity, and other negative effects on securities markets.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Non-Traded Products. </i>Non-traded products do not trade on a 
securities exchange and are not publicly traded.&nbsp; Consequently, 
non-traded products can be riskier than products that are publicly 
traded because the product cannot be sold readily in a market by the 
investor.&nbsp; The non-traded product may offer to redeem shares from 
investors, but such share redemptions are typically subject to 
limitations. Share redemptions may also require that shares be redeemed 
at a discount, and there is no guarantee that an investor will be able 
to redeem the security during the repurchase offer. In addition, 
non-traded products may lack share value transparency because there is 
no market price readily available.&nbsp; Without share value 
transparency, investors may not be able to assess the value or 
performance of the non-traded product.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Options. </i>Option trading is permitted in some LPL advisory 
programs. Investors should be aware that the use of options involves 
additional risks. The risks of covered call writing include the 
potential for the market to rise sharply. In such cases, the security 
may be called away and an investor will no longer hold the security. 
When purchasing options, there is the risk that the entire premium paid 
(the purchase price) for the option can be lost if the option is not 
exercised or is otherwise sold prior to the option’s expiration date. 
When selling (or “writing”) options, the risk of loss can be much 
greater if the options are written uncovered (“naked”). The risk of loss
 can far exceed the amount of the premium received for an uncovered 
option and, in the case of an uncovered call option, the potential loss 
is unlimited.</li>
<li><i>Other Complex Exchange-Traded Products. </i>Certain investors in 
LPL advisory programs meeting qualification standards may also purchase 
other complex exchange-traded products, which may be structured as ETFs,
 ETNs, or other types of securities. Similarly to leveraged and inverse 
products, these other complex products differ, often significantly, from
 traditional ETFs, ETNs, and mutual funds and can be significantly more 
speculative and volatile. Other complex exchange-traded products are 
often designed to not be held long term. These products include, for 
example, futures-linked exchange traded products (“futures linked ETPs”)
 and cryptocurrency-related exchange-traded products (“cryptocurrency 
ETPs”). Futures linked ETPs are intended to provide exposure to 
reference assets like commodities. However, futures linked ETPs are not 
designed to track the spot price of the referenced asset, but instead 
track the price of futures contracts. The performance of a futures 
linked ETP may deviate significantly from the performance of the spot 
price of the reference asset, especially over longer periods. 
Cryptocurrency ETPs are exposed to cryptocurrency, which are 
decentralized digitized assets that often rely on blockchain technology.
 Cryptocurrency ETPs are highly speculative and extremely volatile. 
Cryptocurrency is part of a new and evolving industry, and neither the 
technology nor regulatory regime for cryptocurrency is settled. 
Cryptocurrency ETPs may trade in over-the-counter markets and may not be
 afforded all of the investor protections of other exchange-traded 
products. Certain futures linked ETPs invest in cryptocurrency futures, 
which could magnify the risks described above.</li>
<li><i>Private Equity Funds. </i>Private equity investments are 
speculative and involve significant risks. It is possible that investors
 may lose some or all of their investment. The risks associated with 
private equity include limited diversification, the use of leverage, and
 limited liquidity. The investment timeline for private equity can be a 
decade or more. Some sponsors or general partners may penalize limited 
partners who redeem before holding units for a specified amount of time,
 or may disallow redemptions entirely.</li>
<li><i>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs.)</i> REITs invest in real 
estate, and there are special risks associated with investing in real 
estate, including, but not limited to, sensitivity to changes in real 
estate values, the risk of investment loss due to the use of leveraging 
and other speculative investment practices, interest rate risk, lack of 
liquidity, and performance volatility. Non-traded REITs are not required
 to provide annual valuations until two years and 150 days after raising
 the minimum capital required to begin purchasing properties.&nbsp; This
 threshold is generally outlined in the product’s prospectus. Non-traded
 REITs, which are available to investors in LPL advisory programs who 
meet certain qualification standards, may fund distributions from 
offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of 
capital and reduce the amount of capital available to invest in new 
assets. Investors should be aware that these securities may not be 
liquid, as there is no secondary trading market available. At the 
absolute discretion of the issuer of the security, there may be certain 
repurchase offers made from time to time. However, there is no guarantee
 that the investor will be able to redeem the security during the 
repurchase offer. Issuers may repurchase shares at a price below net 
asset value. The repurchase program may also be suspended under certain 
circumstances.</li>
<li><i>Sector Risk. </i>When an investor invests more heavily in 
particular sectors, industries, or subsectors of the market, the 
investor’s investment performance will be especially sensitive to 
developments that significantly affect those sectors, industries, or 
subsectors. An individual sector, industry, or subsector of the market 
may be more volatile and may perform differently than the broader 
market. The several industries that constitute a sector may all react in
 the same way to economic, political, or regulatory events. An account’s
 performance could be affected if the sectors, industries, or subsectors
 do not perform as expected. Alternatively, the lack of exposure to one 
or more sectors or industries may adversely affect performance.</li>
<li><i>Structured Products. </i>Structured products are securities 
derived from another asset, such as a security or a basket of 
securities, an index, a commodity, a debt issuance, or a foreign 
currency. Structured products frequently limit the upside participation 
in the reference asset. Structured products are senior unsecured debt of
 the issuer and subject to the credit risk associated with that issuer. 
This credit risk exists whether or not the investment held in the 
account offers principal protection. The creditworthiness of the issuer 
does not affect or enhance the likely performance of the investment 
other than the ability of the issuer to meet its obligations. Any 
payments due at maturity are dependent on the issuer’s ability to pay. 
In addition, the trading price of the security in the secondary market, 
if there is one, may be adversely impacted if the issuer’s credit rating
 is downgraded. Some structured products offer full protection of the 
principal invested; others offer only partial or no protection. 
Investors may be sacrificing a higher yield to obtain the principal 
guarantee. In addition, the principal guarantee relates to nominal 
principal and does not offer inflation protection. An investor in a 
structured product never has a claim on the underlying investment, 
whether a security, zero coupon bond, or option. There may be little or 
no secondary market for the securities, and information regarding 
independent market pricing for the securities may be limited. This is 
true even if the product has a ticker symbol or has been approved for 
listing on an exchange. Tax treatment of structured products may be 
different from other investments held in the account (e.g., income may 
be taxed as ordinary income even though payment is not received until 
maturity). Structured CDs that are insured by the FDIC are subject to 
applicable FDIC limits.</li>
<li><i>Annuity Products.</i> If investor client invests in annuity 
products in a Program account, client should be aware of the specific 
risks and limitations of the annuity products.&nbsp; Clients should be 
aware that certain riders purchased with a variable annuity may limit 
the investment options and the ability to manage the subaccounts. Some 
products may charge a recapture or redemption fee for contracts or 
benefits not held for a specified period of time or that do not follow 
stated withdrawal terms. Registered Index Linked Annuities (RILAs) are 
insurance products tied to the performance of a market index, offering 
the positive returns of the index up to a cap and providing a buffer for
 a certain level of negative returns. RILAs are subject to risks 
associated with other investment products, including market risk, and 
the total loss of principal is possible. If client purchases an annuity 
product that is part of a Program, client will receive a prospectus with
 respect to the terms and conditions of the annuity product.</li>
<li><i>Cash Holdings. </i>LPL advisory programs are generally designed 
as long-term investment programs. Requests to allocate all or a portion 
of an account to cash will affect the performance of an investor’s 
account. LPL generally earns advisory fees on cash holdings and also 
earns fees for its cash sweep programs.&nbsp; The advisory and other 
fees that LPL earns on cash holdings have been, and may continue in the 
future to be, higher than the yields earned by investors on cash 
holdings.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Equity Securities. </i>Common and preferred stock represents the 
equity ownership of a company. Stock markets are volatile and the price 
of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company’s 
financial condition and overall market and economic conditions. The 
value of equity securities may also decline due to factors that affect 
particular industries or particular issuers. The values of equity 
securities may be more volatile than those of other asset classes.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Debt Securities.</i> Debt securities, such as bonds, involve 
interest rate risk, credit risk, extension risk, prepayment risk, and 
other types of risks. In addition, the value of debt securities may 
fluctuate in response to market movements or issues that affect 
particular industries or issuers. When interest rates fall, the issuers 
of debt securities may prepay principal more quickly than expected, and 
investors may have to reinvest the proceeds at a lower interest rate. 
This is known as “prepayment risk.” When interest rates rise, debt 
securities may be repaid more slowly than expected, and the value of the
 debt security can fall sharply. This is known as “extension risk.” 
Certain types of debt securities may be subject to “call and redemption 
risk,” which is the risk that the issuer may call a bond for redemption 
before it matures and the investor may lose income.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Cyber Security Risk. </i>Failures or breaches of the electronic 
systems of securities market participants or the issuers of securities 
can cause significant losses for investors.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Foreign Securities Risk. </i>Foreign investments involve special 
risks not present in U.S. investments that increase an investor’s 
potential to lose money. Among other issues, custody of securities in 
foreign markets, changes in foreign currency exchange rates,&nbsp; 
foreign economic and market conditions, actions adverse to investors 
taken by foreign governments, lack of governmental oversight or 
regulation of securities markets, underdeveloped settlement and clearing
 services, and foreign withholding taxes may negatively affect the value
 of investments in foreign securities.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Values-Based and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Investing Risk. </i>Values-
based investing or ESG investing, also known as “socially responsible 
investing,” “sustainable investing,” or “impact investing,” focuses on 
the social values or environmental, social, and governance standards or 
the sustainability factors of an investment. Some values-based investing
 strategies focus on factors relating to an individual investor’s 
personal or religious values, such as “biblical investing,” while other 
strategies focus on issues like environmental impact.&nbsp; Some 
values-based investment strategies use values-based criteria to 
supplement financial analysis when considering a particular issuer or 
security, while others affirmatively select “socially responsible” 
investments or screen out or exclude investments in companies that 
engage in certain activities. Values-based investing may limit the type 
and number of investments available in a strategy and cause the strategy
 to underperform other strategies without a values-based focus or with a
 focus that involves a different type of focus or screening methodology.
 Values-based strategies may underperform the market as a whole. 
Companies and issuers selected in a values-based strategy may not or may
 not continue to demonstrate values-based characteristics. Different 
investors likely have different opinions about what types of investments
 are socially responsible.&nbsp;</li>
